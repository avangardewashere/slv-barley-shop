- SQL injection and XSS protection
- PCI compliance for payment data
- GDPR compliance for customer data

### Performance Standards
- Page load times < 2 seconds
- API response times < 500ms
- Database queries optimized with indexes
- Caching strategy for all read operations
- Image optimization and CDN usage

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for critical functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Code review process for all changes

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- **Development**: Local with Docker containers
- **Staging**: Full feature testing environment
- **Production**: Scalable cloud deployment

### Database Migration Strategy
- Incremental schema updates
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Data migration scripts
- Rollback procedures

### Release Process
